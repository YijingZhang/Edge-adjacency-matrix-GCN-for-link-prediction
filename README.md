# Edge-adjacency-matrix-GCN-for-link-prediction
A novel link prediction method for graph
Firstly, the node adjacency matrix for grpah it tranferred to the edge adjacency matrix. The existing edges can be regarded as the labelled "nodes" for edge-style graph. Using GCN proposed by Thomas Kipf for semi-supervised learning, the hidden existing edges can be inferred instanteneously.
